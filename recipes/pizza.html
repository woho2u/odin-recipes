    <h1>Great pizza</h1>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. 
        You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, 
        chewy crust.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. 
                You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make 
                it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
